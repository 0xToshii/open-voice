# Open Voice

A speech-to-text application for macOS that allows you to dictate into any application using global hotkeys and AI-enhanced text processing.

## More Info

Open Voice is a Mac desktop application that transforms speech into text and intelligently inserts it into any application you're using. Simply press **Cmd+Option**, speak naturally, and watch your words appear in your current text field with AI-powered enhancements.

It's heavily influenced by Aqua Voice - but the idea here is that you can have the same experience while enjoying BYOK (bring your own key) and pay-as-you-go pricing across multiple providers.

### Multi-Provider Architecture

Open Voice supports multiple AI providers, each offering both **speech-to-text** and **LLM processing** capabilities. These are all plug-and-play, and just require you to get a key:

**Providers:**
1. **OpenAI:** Get a [key](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. **Groq:** Get a [key](https://console.groq.com/).

There is also a **Local Whisper** option which runs locally, without LLM processing, requiring no setup.
